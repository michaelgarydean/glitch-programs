game on neopets.com It was terrible.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Apparently the point of the game was to get your character to shout "Whoo-Hoo!" as many times as possible before you splattered your brains on the rocks, all the while listening to a soundtrack that is similar to a dying ceiling fan.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of course, when I started out I accidentally hit the rocks approximately three million times.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Halfway though I used my four remaining brain-cells to decide that the game was dumb.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So my goal changed from surviving to laughing evilly while my character died.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So the game naturally did everything it could to preserve my life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The stupid game is still going on and I refuse to quit because I want my points.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My character is actually dodging the stupid rocks better now then when I controlled him.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I hate irony.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Seeya.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Okay.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now I'm back again.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Today I added an update page, which is

the Braves will win this year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Okay, the whole braves thing is made up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But everything else I've said so far is

to a bar and play pool!!!!!*waits for readers to become insanely jealous*<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yep, that's right, a bar with a pool table!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not only did we get world class cuisine (under-cooked hotdogs and over-cooked hamburgers), my little sister (age 10) got taught pool by someone I strongly supect is an ex-convict!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Naturally when it was announced that we'd be eating dinner in this place, I could hardly contain my excitment(I glared at my mother and asked why we couldn't go to Pizza Hut)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When we arrived, we were promptly served (after thirty minutes)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In the meantime, we played a family game of pool(my parents played while my brother and sister and I watched)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After two rousing rounds, our food came.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The food was superb, (our food came the exact opposite of how we ordered it, and half of the onion rings were missing)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then we joyfully returned to our game(my sister and the ex-con played my mom)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We spent hours there (from 5p.m.-7:15p.m.) There were many people that were the same age as me and my siblings (no one in the room but us were under 30) Us kids had to be dragged kicking and screaming from the bar ( I almost fell asleep during the last game I watched)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As we left, there was a feeling of goodwill and fellowship between all(my sister locked me out of the car and wouldn't let me in untill I started yelling profanity in her general direction)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The high point of the entire night was when my mother gave me $21 for my report card.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She promptly borrowed $1 to help with the waitresses tip(This part I'm not being sarcastic about)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All in all it was a night I'll remember forever (as the lowest point in "family outing"history, except for that time my mom dragged me to a church thing on the concept of truth.)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My brother(age 13) even decided upon a new job he wants when he's old enough to work, a busboy at the bar.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We had to tell him that he would probley have to wait untill he was 21.(Absolutly nothing about that statement was sarcastic)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As you can see, I love my families outings(Not unless you're blind...or

A lot has happened. Like my EVIL school computer deleting my updates page. But it's all good. Especially since I just saw The Matrix: Reloaded. The following text may spoil the movie for you, so WARNING: do no read this unless you have already seen the movie. Okay. What I liked best was the philosophy on choices. (the mindless fight scenes were really cool, too). It's like this. In the beginning of the movie, Neo is having dreams about Trinity's death. Later, The Oracle tells him that he has already decided her fate. Towards the end of the movie, Neo chooses to tell Trinity to stay out of the Matrix, since he saw her die in it. She agrees, but only after seeing how important it is to him. After a horrific chain of events (is it coincidence, or fate) the people who will deactivate the secondary power source of the building Neo is infiltrating, die. So...the plan is going to fail. Unless someone does something, Neo, Morpheus and many others will die. Trinity, who is of course outside of the Matrix, knows this and chooses to enter the Matrix to save the day. The events of Neo's dream unfold. So...when the oracle said that the choice had already been made, she was completely correct. The moment Neo woke from dreams of Trinity's death, he made a choice. He would do everything in his power to keep his dream from becoming reality. So he kept her out of the Matrix, and she saw the problem, and entered the Matrix to fix it. If she had been in the Matrix, she would have likely been with Morpheus, never would have known about the plan's failure, would therefore not have been in the situation that resulted in her death. And the plan would have failed and Neo might have died, along with a large portion of the city (the building was set to blow if there was any intruders) So...Neo's choice to attempt to save Trinity triggered the sequence of events that led to her death. As Neo realizes all of this, through a nearly omniscient Architect of the Matrix, he makes another choice. This choice is simply an extension of his original choice: he will save Trinity at all costs. Neo is told that he has two choices. He can save mankind, and doom Trinity. Or he can try to save Trinity and doom mankind. No guarantee that he'll succeed in saving Trinity. He goes for Trinity, makes it just in time to catch her body, and starts her heart back up. In return for not taking the easy route, he gains a power in the more or less real world. He can deactivate the machines, (squidies) but at great personal cost. The movie ends with him in a coma. Now, you must realize that I have described only one aspect of this movie of all movies. There are not enough words in the English language to describe the sheer coolness of the fight choreography, special effects and the plot. I highly recommend you see the movie yourself. I'm sorry that today's rant isn't random, insane or completely chaotic, but I must right my experience with The Matrix before I forget. I am so buying this movie when it comes out on DVD. I love it! You have to admit its sheer coolness. I mean, come on! It's the sequel to the movie that revolutionized the standard by which we judge special effects. I better stop typing before I have a heart attack...just remember...The Matrix has you...I'm back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And throughly pissed off at my school system in general.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You see...they feel that the only way to reward academic achievement...yada-yada-yada...is to force the smart kids to be ushers for Senior Honor Nite, and Graduation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Where is the logic in this?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I for one, didn't know about such dire consequences for not deliberatly failing classes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was bad enough that I was forced to "volunteer" my precious time (i could have worked on this site)...no...I was forced to wear formal attire.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My school system is stuck in the past...and formal attire means...a dress...a white dress...(for those you who never bothered to find out...I am indeed female).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So...for the first time in about 5 years...I wore a dress...and something that was complelty white.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What cruel fate is this?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To compound the EVIL situation...I was forced to wear feminine shoes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In other words...they hurt.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And they pushed my toes together.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Since I have a rather weird phobia of touching my own skin...this made my evening my own personall torture session.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think that such gender-specific torture should be deemed inhumane and abolished from our great society...of flaming chickens.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Henceforth...Code: 666 of the Flaming Chickens Handbook states that under no circumstance will the Patron Saint of Paper Clips (guess who) be forced to wear anything other than a t-shirt and preferably black jeans.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Should you violate this right, you will become destroyed or possibly dizzy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I'm leaving now...I have some destruction to do.</p>

And so, in the interest of wasting even more time, I made a list.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here we go!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Number One:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I could have cured cancer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not that I know anything about medicine...or cancer for that matter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I'm sure that if I just would have put my mind to it, I could have done it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Number Two:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I could helped the earth to find eternal and lasting peace.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Which would be boring.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So I at least have an excuse for not doing that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Number Three: I could have studied and stuff.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Uh...don't think so...Number Four:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I could have learned to drive.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This would have resulted in the deaths of numerous pedistrians...and I would still probably be wondering around in search of a McDonalds.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Number Five:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I could have read more books, played more video games and watched more mindless television.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Gee...I wish I'd thought of that sooner.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Number Six:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I could have implemented one of several plans for world domination.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or, as an alternative, I could have ruined several plans for world domination that other people made.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Number Seven:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I could drive people crazy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Wait...aren't I already doing that?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Scratch number seven.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And on to: Number Eight:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I could have...uhhhh...ummmmm...actually thought up these things before hand.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Number Nine:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now it's just getting redundant, isn't it?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Number Ten:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This is the list that never ends.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yes, it goes on and on my friend.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One person, started typing it not knowing what it was, and they'll continue typing it forever just because this is the list that never ends, yes it goes on and on my friends, some person started typing it not...etc, etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Okay...I admit it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I have officialy run out of ways I could have better spent my time. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I don't think there actually &lt;b&gt;are&lt;/b&gt; any.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Except for maybe five and six.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now, &lt;U&gt;those&lt;/u&gt; have possibilities.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>However, I am currently content to just sit here and type.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For the benefit of you, the reader...who may or may not exist.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Either way, I'm continuing to sort of entertain myself.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I feel like I should be outraged about some topic or another.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I just can't work up the energy to be outraged.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Perhaps a nice, soothing mistrust.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yeah.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I can work with mistrust.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I definitly mistrust lots of stuff.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Like organ grinders, and the evil conspiracies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Did you know, that Kodak was part of the conspiracy to assasinate John F. Kennedy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now, some of you are probably thinking "Gee, Really?", or "Wow, I never knew that!" while others are thinking "Who's John F. Kennedy?" or possibly "Who or What is Kodak".<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I fervently hope that you're not thinking the last two...especially about Kodak.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Kodak, as you may know, is a film developing company.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And John F. Kennedy (JFK) was an alien bent on global domination.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or possibly a really good president who wanted to fly to the moon.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Either way, he got assasinated.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And ever loony in America decided that it was a conspiracy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some even go so far as to claim that Kodak "changed" the pictures of the assasination to make an assasination in the bushes become a tree's shadow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I didn't know that they had such good technology back then.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I have to wonder...why would Kodak do such a thing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Perhaps Kodak is actually a front organization for a shadowy governmental system that controls the entire world and didn't want mankind to obtain the freedom of the stars and so tried to sabotauge the space program even though it didn't work as well as they planned.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or perhaps not.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Either way, Kodak is undeniably evil.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How can any company that takes so many "wholesome" pictures not be?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You can just bet that they look at every one that get's turned in to them, judging blackmail value, and whether or not you could get arrested.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It's just sickening, you can't even take a simple photo nowadays.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Unless you have a digital camera, which are a symbol of freedom from the old ways and willing enslavement to the new ways.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We can only hope that the digital camera manufacturers are kinder masters than the evil Kodak Lords.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I better go...I think Kodak is tracing my site....I'm back now!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And, once again, I have proof that someone actually took the time (two hours) to read this entire Longest Text Ever!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It's amazing, it's incredible, it's unbelievable.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But true.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even more incredible, this time it's someone I don't even know!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Wooooooo!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I feel inspired and happy and other really good emotions and stuff.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And so, I'll take a trip down memory lane, to the dark depths of the past, to when I decided to make this page.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was inspired, in part, by my sheer and utter boredom.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In school, back before I even owned a computer, I'd type random words for long periods of time, 'cause I had nothing better to do.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Once I got this computer, I decided to do something similar on my beloved site.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But, it ended up making more sense than I anticipated (scary thought, huh).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Oh, well...I tired of nostalgia.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Back to the present.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Right now, I'm just typing so that no one can say that I've been slacking off.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I don't think I have any conspiracy theories...except pop-ups/pop-unders.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Have you ever had the evil pop-up that says that if you click here, it'll get rid off all the annoying pop-ups?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Isn't that sort of ironic?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Could the pop-up blocker people have chosen a better means to advertise their product?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It's like grand-theft auto 3's talk show, you know, the one where there are &lt;u&gt;C&lt;/u&gt;itizens &lt;u&gt;R&lt;/u&gt;aging &lt;u&gt;A&lt;/u&gt;gainst &lt;U&gt;P&lt;/u&gt;hones?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or CRAP, for short.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And the lady representing them, calls the radio station...on a phone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It's stupid and ironic and just shouldn't exist in a better world.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Pop-Up ad's help you get rid of pop-up ads?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Insane, chaotic...hmmmmm...I wonder who thought of it?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Was it<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>on purpose, or was it just some mistake?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is now my civic duty to discover this ancient mystery, and reveal it to the uncaring world.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or maybe I'll go make a frozen pizza.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yeah.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That sounds good, too.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Since I'm not particualarly inspired at the moment, I should leave and let you gather what is left of your sanity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I just can't seem to stop, though.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Okay...I can do it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I'm leaving.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I'm back...and it's several hours later.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I've decided to imortalize the stupidity of my dog, Moose.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She is a heavy-set Yorkshire Terrior (12 lbs.)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In otherwords, she's a small yappy dog who is big for her breed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Today, I met her arch-enemy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An enemy so terrifying that Moose cannot stop shaking.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An enemy so hideous that Moose must destroy it at all costs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>An enemy so dangerous that Moose fears it above all others.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now you may be wondering what horrible beast is Moose's arch-enemy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And you probably suspect that it is something pathetic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You would be correct in your suspiciousness...for Mooses arch-enemy is...*dramatic drumroll*...a small, white, feather.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now, Moose has seen many feathers, birds even.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But none have struck terror in her little moose heart like this particular feather.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So...naturally I put her arch-enemy in my pocket and brought it home with me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This action has made her very suspicious of where my loyalties lie.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She tracks the feather smell all over the house, and goes crazy whenever I take it out of my pocket.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She even got her sister and mother in the spirt of things.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now her sister sounds an alarm whenever she sees the evil feather.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now, you may be wondering what is so terrifying about a small, white, feather.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So am I.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It doesn't smell funny, (I asked my brother, since I don't have a sense of smell), it seems perfectly ordinary.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So, I've decided that Moose works for some secret government organization, and that the feather is the key to the destruction of the world, and I am just blithely letting it enter our home, so that it may furthur its evil plans to destroy the universe.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That is the only possible explanation as to why it upsets her so much.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or...maybe it's the feather off of the cartoon owl from the tootsie-roll pop comercials (one...two...three..*crunch*).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Whatever the case, I decided that the whole world, (or three of four random people) deserve to know that if the world and or universe are destroyed, it's the evil, little, white, feather's fault.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now I'd better go and torture my Moose with it...:) I am officially back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And you, the potentially non-existant reader gets a once in a lifetime chance to hear me rant and rave about my &lt;a href="tripquilt.html"&gt;Horrible, Horrible Family Vacation&lt;/a&gt;.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I know.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You feel very, very honored.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It's like this.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My mother is a control freak, and she decided on the spur of the moment that we were going north to visit relatives.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Later that day, she decided we were NOT going north, we were going south to a beach resort.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Still later that day, she got offended at some trivial thing and decided that we weren't going anywhere at all.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The very next day, she decided that we were going north, after all.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So, we packed everthing up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Before we knew it, we were on the road.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The first part of the trip was fairly easy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As in, I was half-asleep, hoping that we'd arrive while I slept.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then, in an inspired move, my brother talked my mother into letting him sit up front.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That meant that my mother would be in the back, with me and my younger, eviler sister.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Immediatly, my mother started complaining.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was uncomfortable in the back, it was too hot, it was too cold.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then, she accidently woke our three yappy dogs up, and they relized that they were in a car.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That meant only one corse of action for them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They started shaking and barked their little heads off.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This annoyed my mother further, untill she asked, no, &lt;b&gt;demanded&lt;/b&gt; that my father turn the car around so that we could go home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Unfortuantly, we had already driven 337 miles toward our destination.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After much argument, my father was going to turn around, untill he realized that my mother was going to drop the dogs and me off, and then turn around and continue north.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This seemed slightly unpracticle, so we ended up not taking that 337 mile detour.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We eventually reached our destination after 16 hours of virtually non-stop driving.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We got there, we ate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We slept.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My mother visited relatives.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And so the week went by.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I got to go to a huge library, and see Terminator 3 at the local theater.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That was the high point of the entire trip.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The last day, we were deciding where to eat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My mom said that she didn't care.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So my dad picked a steak place.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My mother tried to order a mushroom-swiss burger...only to discover that the place had no swiss-cheese.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So she decided on a salad, only to discover that they didn't have her favorite salad dressing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After much deliberation, she decided that she wouldn't eat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After complaining how hungry she was, and about the poor quality of the resteraunt, she walked out of the resteraunt, instructing the rest of us to "enjoy our meals".<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And I wonder where my little sister gets her annoyingness.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not that my mother is annoying...just set in her ways.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The whole meal thing was about the only interesting thing to happen during the week. On the way home, we had gotten approximatly 4 hours into the trip when my mother predicatably decided that we had to go back and eat at the 50th aniversary of her favorite ice cream place.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Needless to say, we ignored her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Oh, and when my sister had to go to the bathroom very badly during a traffic jam, my mother had the good taste to making hissing/water noises to make my sister's problem worse.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She claimed that my little sister always did it to her, and she was getting pay-back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Between her bickering with my sister, and obsessivly playing neopets games, I don't know what to do with her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Anyway...that was my family vacation rant.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It sucked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No suprise.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At least it's over.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sorry if I complained a lot.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you don't like it, start your own longest text ever.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Anyway, I promise to go back to my usual routine the next time I rant here.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I thought of a topic on the way home, but forgot it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Seeya.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I'm back!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I know, I took you completly by suprise.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You thought you'd gotten rid of me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>*cheesy super-hero voice* Well, fear not, random citizen, for I, PSOPC am here! *normal voice* Today I have a very important to discuss with you in this: &lt;b&gt;PERFECTLY NORMAL PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCMENT&lt;/b&gt;.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yes, that's right.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It's time to warn you, the viewer...er...reader...about the evils of various stuff. Today's lesson is: subliminal messages .<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That's right, folks, mass hypnosis via commercials.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now, I'm sure you've at least &lt;b&gt;heard&lt;/b&gt; of subliminal messages , right? No? Well...prepare to be enlightened.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Subliminal messages are an advertising technique that puts hidden pictures and words into a main image.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You don't see them, but your subconsious (dreaming) mind does.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Your subconsious mind acts on whatever it is told.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What does this mean to you? It means that WAL-MART TV IS EVIL! EVIIIIIIIIIIIIL!!!!!! Why else would they invest all that money to show commercials in their own store? Because they put subliminal messages in them, of course!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Subliminal messanging also explains the successes of certain fast-food resteraunts, and brand name items.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>BEWARE YOUR TOASTER OVEN! Okay.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That had nothing to do whatsoever with subliminal messages...it's just cool to say.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Anyway, only watch wal-mart if you WANT to be subliminaly entertained into purchasing a new set of TUPERWARE, even though your old set is PERFECTLY fine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This has been a public service announcment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Pretty cool, huh?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Uh...you don't have to take the subliminal stuff seriously.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It's true, and all, but I have no proof about wal-mart, or certain fast food resteraunts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It makes sense, though.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Wal-mart TV is evil.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You cannot deny it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Seeya...hmmm..I wonder if there's subliminal stuff in my computer...I'm back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And I feel that it's time for a FAKE commercial break, for the highly informed, obviously brain-dead consumer. &lt;I&gt;And now, a word from our non-existant sponsor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ketchup: The only food that you'll want to eat after traveling to the 5th Dimension.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It's been practically proven that Ketchup transforms into a highly intoxicating (non-addictive) delicious substance upon returning from the 5th Dimension.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Stock up now with our Valu-Pak to recieve 3-metric tons of Ketchup, all for the low, low price of your brain, since you're obviously not using it anyway.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then, just wait for technology to "catch-up" (get it, catch-up, Ketchup?)so you can travel to the 5th Dimension like our scientists almost did. &lt;/i&gt;(Next Commercial) &lt;i&gt;Get ready fo: Faux's new "reality" TV show, "How Low Can &lt;u&gt;We&lt;/u&gt; Go?"

I bet you wanna go eat some Ketchup covered Dum-B Gon right now, while watching "reality" TV.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just make sure you "spray" your food first.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Pathetic, wasn't it? Oh, well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was bored, and a dilligent reader suggested I make fake commercials, so...therer they are.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Happy? Good.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I'm leavin', for now. I'm back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And I'm willing to enlighten you, the potentially you-know-what reader.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Today, I was checking out some weird news. At one point, I read an article that stated that it had been proven, conclusivly, that Kansas was flatter than the standard pancake.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The researches even used highly advanced technololgy to map the surface of a pancake and compare it to documented geology of Kansas. Some people disagree, the director of the Kansas Geological Survey said "I think this is part of a vast breakfast food conspiracy to denigrate Kansas. It's a cheap shot." So...doesn't that make you want to take Kansas' side (I sincerly appologize if you are from Kansas).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It just seems extremly weird (and worthy of mentioning) that this semi-important guy from Kansas believes in a "vast breakfast food conspiracy".<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Makes you think that the long held belief that Kodak conspired with the JFK assasin(s) is normal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Another article claims that an anitseptic turned a polar bear purple, drawing large crowds of people.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I sure hope other zoos won't copy them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Before you know it, we'll have orange alligators, pink tigers and blue lions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>School children won't be able to correctly identify the color of a zebra.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Random people will think they've gone crazy, after a seemingly innocent visit to the zoo.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It's wrong, I tell you.

Work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I love my work, I love the kids I work with.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I HATE spending three hours of every day in a "class" when everyone else's class is only an hour and a half.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I don't care if I have to ride the bus home if I stop work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I don't care if I'd get home only an hour or so before I normaly do.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I want an elective.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maybe.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All I know is that I've been assuming one thing while the person in charge has been assuming a completly different thing. Neither of us thought to question the other.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And so I'm in deep doo-doo.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>*sniffle* I just want to have some FREAKIN' variety in my daily grind, you know? I don't WANT to do the same thing for an entire year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yeah, I know, regular schedule schools do that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I pity them, I really do.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I've spent the past three years of my life EXPECTING each semester to be like a mini-year.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I DO NOT LIKE CHANGE! This is just way too much of a change at once.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I don't want year-round classes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I don't want a full year of work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I don't want to be in this mess...I'm going to bed. I'm back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I don't have much of a choice about the whole work thing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Plus, the kids at the daycare (where I work, obviously) say that I'm "cool to talk to".<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That makes me feel alll warm and fuzzy inside.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Like a muffin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They just like how I know lots of pointless laws and random facts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Okay.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>ON TO THE CONPIRACY OF THE DAY!:</p>
<p class="p1">I've had this nagging fear that I am part of some random but vast conspiracy (about what I'm not sure but it must be vast).</p>
<p class="p1">Meanwhile there is a vast conspiracy at school to keep me ignorant about my pawn roll in the other vast conpiracy by keeping me vastly bored. (In a very vast sense) And: did you ever notice that the word "conspiracy" is vastly similar to the word "constipation". I only mention this 'cause I've accidently spelled constipation instead of conspiracy a few times. (on accident, vast number of times)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hee-Hee! Isn't vast a funny word? You can just picture sterotypical pirates saying, "A vast ye mateys!". I'm not exactly sure what that means, but it sure is funny:) You don't agree? Shame on you! &lt;b&gt;Code: 888 of The Flaming Chickens Handbook states that The Patron Saint of Paperclips (still me) is always right.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>ALWAYS.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the facts beg to differ, than the facts are wrong.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>End of story.&lt;/b&gt; Seeya.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I'm back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I've been playing one of the new neopets slot machines (black pawkeet).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I'm completly and totally addicted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Gambling is so much fun! I've won 500 np, at least and I'm on a roll.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now sure, I could have won more than 500 at some game in which you don't have to pay to play.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But, what would be the fun in that?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I even came up with a mathematical explanation for why gambling is fun (while I was eating a hyper-speed dinner, thinking nothing of getting back to the slot machine).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Okay.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you don't understand the concept of numbers less than zero, (negative numbers) just skip this part.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Imagine a number line that points in the positive and negative direction.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When I start playing a game, I am on 0.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I have neither won nor lost money/neopoints.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When I win 500np on a normal game, I move to the 500 point.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There is exactly 500 units of distance between the two extremes of winning amounts (0 and 500) BUT! When I play a gambling game,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>there is a possibility that I'll lose everything, so I start on negative however much NP I have with me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If I had 500np with me, I'd be at-500.</p>
<p class="p1">Then, when I win 500 additional np, I move to the 500np point.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The distance between the two extremes of how much I could have won is 1000np, making me feel like I've won much more than if I'd played a normal game. Did you understand that? Good.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I probably won't later.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But that is irrelevant. Goodbye!</p>
<p class="p1">I am back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And I hava a very, almost special rant for you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The previous sentence made absolutly no sense.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Good for it. In a recent article, humorist Dave Barry discussed the addictive quality of the snack food, Cheez-Its.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Naturally, I had many mixed feelings, primarily disgust, as I have not voluntarily eaten a Cheez-It in quite some time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They're disgusting, bland and definitly not made of cheez, whatever that is.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My family has &lt;u&gt;always&lt;/u&gt; bought Cheez-Its, to the point of making me physically sick at the thought of eating one. (To this day, however, I will almost literally kill for a box of Cheez-It party mix, as it is a rare commodity at my house.)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fortunatly, my mom recently &lt;u&gt;finnaly&lt;/u&gt; switched our snack food preference.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>To Cheese Nips.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Say it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Out loud.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What does it sound like?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When you look at them they are identical to the evil little Cheez-Its.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The only difference is the taste, which I enjoy, since it is new and different.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What I want to know is this: are there no intelectual property rights in the world of food products?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I mean, don't you &lt;u&gt;think&lt;/u&gt; the creators of Cheese-Nips had a box of Cheez-Its out when they were designing &lt;u&gt;their&lt;/u&gt; product?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It seems like blaggerent plagerism.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The only reason the makers of Cheese-Nips don't get sued is because of the tast difference and Cheese Nips are made of real "cheese" rather than cheez.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It makes you think of Name-Brand vs. Generic cereal brands.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They are the &lt;u&gt;samething&lt;/u&gt;, with the &lt;u&gt;same look&lt;/u&gt;, and almost &lt;u&gt;same name&lt;/u&gt;. But people buy name brands.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Why, because they assume it's better quality.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Plus, boxes are more convient than bags.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A profound statement, if I ever heard one. Any way, I'm leaving to eat some Cheessy goodness!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I'm back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Apparantly my standards of weird have gone up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This morning, my Mom came home from work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was upset, because she had accidently run over an armidillo. She said she hurt it the first time, and wanted to put it out of it's misery, so she went back and ran over it 11 more times.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But it's legs were still moving and it was alive.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was extremly upset.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When I related this story to my friends (including &lt;a href="aboutmeg.html"&gt;"Meg"&lt;/a&gt;) they thought it was hilarious.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They couldn't stop laughing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I thought it was sad...and normal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They particularly liked how I said that she went back and ran over it 11 more times.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I'm not sure why.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of course, when I next saw my Mom, she retold the story to me, several times.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With the exact same words, motions and emotions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She didn't think it was weird, either.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Perhaps my family is just so weird, we've lost all sense of perspective. Or maybe it's everybody else that's weird.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I just don't know.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What do you think, Hypothetical Reader? You don't know either?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hmmmmm...what is this world coming to?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Oh, by the way, I was paid a decent compliment today.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One of my friends (who laughed at the armidillo story) named Tonileigh said "Jenny (that's me) is weirder than the average Psycho." and " You think Jenny's weird?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Wait till you see her in angry mob form!" Now &lt;u&gt;THAT'S&lt;/u&gt; just weird.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"angry mob form"?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That just sounds nifty! I can clone myself and form and angry mob? In anycase, this was particularly funny because Tonileigh is one of my "normaler" friends.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although I tell you she can't &lt;b&gt;possibly&lt;/b&gt; be normal, since she hangs out with me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Anyway, I'm gonna go.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I gots stuff to do!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I'm back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you'll look toward the bottom of this page, you'll notice that I added a nifty little thing called the "babel fish".<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It will translate any thing, to anything else.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ain't it nifty? What's really fun is to translate an English saying, like out of sight, out of mind.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then, when it's in German, or whatever, translate it back to English.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It's so completly garbled, it's funny.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For instance, I wrote: "I am the Crazy Taco!", and translated it to German.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I then copied and pasted the German and put it in the text box.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I translated it from German to English and got "I am the Moved Taco!"<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>See? Hours of completly useless fun!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This has been my hourly Public Service Announcement that I only do when I feel like it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Seeya!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I'm back!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Woooo! And do I ever have a topic today!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I've been a paranoid, conspiracy seeking mood lately and the newest threat to my sanity is:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>smoke detectors!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Come on, think about it! In all those 911 shows, people wake up and their house is engulfed in flames.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The smoke detector either never went off, or went off and the people just slept through it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Okay, fire is loud. And hot...and smoky.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you can sleep through a raging fire, close enough to set off the smoke detector, then you are definitly going to sleep through the smoke detector.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Plus, the fire gradually gets louder, and hotter, and smokier.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The sleeping person will gradually get used to it (and incorporate it into their dreams).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By the time the smoke dector goes off, the fire has drowned it out to no more than an annoying buzz.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My point is that smoke detectors have very little value in home security.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Okay, one day, in the future, smoke dectectors will probably activate litte fire-fighter bots that every home will have.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But untill that day, the concept of the smoke detector is useless.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you're awake to hear it, chances are that you've already noticed the smoke, fire and eminent danger.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you're asleep, the fire will wake you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So, that leads us to the evil paranoid conspiracy I thought of the other night.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What if the smoke detectors have tiny litte cameras in them?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That would explain that annoying green little blinkie light in them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Unless, of course, the government was smart enough to have cameras without the blinkie light.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In any case, wouldn't the blinkie light help night-vision cameras see in the dark? It only takes a little light to help those thingies, and smoke detectors provide more than a little.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I can even see the shadow of my hand on the wall from the light those things shed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It's annoying.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here I am, trying to get a decent nights sleep and there's this green light that periodically blinks to red directly in front of me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It's a small light, but it's sooooooo annoying.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There MUST be some sort of conspiracy involved, 'cause if there is, I can get rid of the EVIL thing!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So, fellow conspiracy nuts: Take down the evil governmental safety device and take it apart.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you can still think during all that incessent beeping, you'll probably find evidence that I'm really paranoid.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or possibly right...that would be scary.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In any case...I guess that smoke detectors are a neccesary evil...but...WHY DO THEY HAVE TO HAVE THAT STUPID LIGHT?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Does it serve an obvious purpose? No! That's why it MUST be EVIL! You cannot deny the logic of my thinking!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now...I'm gonna go and worry about the light on my toaster oven...seeya!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>*sighs dramatically* I'm back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It's not fair, ya know?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Each Friday, I wait (all tingly with anticipation) for the weekend so that I can stay up 'till the wee hours of the morning and sleep past noon. But my idiotic body has an automatic alarm clock, or something.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>During the weekdays, I get about seven hours of sleep (usually less) and wake up at 6:11 a.m.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yep.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now, some of you are probably calling me a whiner, 'cause you have to get up at 4:30, or whatever. And lots of you are probably gloating 'cause you don't have to get up 'till 8:30.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The reason I have to get up at 6 something is that I...I...I ride the bus to school.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yeah...I know...pathetic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Believe me, though, you &lt;u&gt;never&lt;/u&gt; want to see me drive...I get easily distracted by clouds and signs saying FREE KITTIES!...kitties are hugable...but if you hug them...they'll scratch your eyes out...so then you have to hiss at them and establish dominence...but kitties don't like that...even though dogs do...but kitties are obviously not dogs...even though they are fuzzy.) So...my lack of a car and driving skills force me to use the bus, which comes for me 45 minutes before my school even starts.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It's stupid.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It only takes me a few minutes to get ready, then I can go back to bed. Now...I bet you're wondering why I don't just wake up a few minutes before I have to go.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My sister.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My evil, EVIL sister.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That's why.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She's evil.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>SHE has to get up at 6:11 to put on make-up, do her hair and basically annoy the heck out of me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So rather than battle her over the concept of getting dressed in the dark, I get up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Oh...I'm rambling again, aren't I? Back to the original topic! So...when the weekend rolls around, I'm fairly exhausted.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But, my stupid internal alarm clock is starting to wake me up around six. I can usually fall back asleep (if I don't panic and think I'm late for school), but the stupid thing wakes me up again exactly seven hours after I originally fell asleep.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Which is why it's not even 10:00 and here I am, typing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Which I suppose may be a good thing, seeing as how I'm currently in a Longest Text Ever Rivalry with Galaxy Dreamer's site.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>*cough*She's winning*cough*<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But that's just because I have so much to do to mantain and update this site, I rarely get a chance to just sit here and type.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Oh, and I would like to mention to my *snicker* LOYAL fans that this Longest Text Ever DOES get updated at least once a week, so please, please, please, PLEASE do not read this once, in one sitting and then leave forever, and ever and ever! It makes me sad...*sniffle*<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Well...I feel better now.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Did you know that I now possess a DOMAIN NAME?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yep.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That's right!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It'll be ready soon, ain't it great?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Okay, back to the flaming-chickens LTE rivalry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Another reason why this isn't as long as Galaxy's is that I refuse to write every day as it would--this is the funny part--LOWER THE QUALITY OF MY OVERALL WORK! HA-HA! HILARIOUS! "lower the &lt;u&gt;quality&lt;/u&gt;"?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sometimes I crack myself up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If this was &lt;u&gt;quality&lt;/u&gt; work, I'd publish it and make a fortune.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Speaking of publishing, I do plan on somehow, someday publishing this as the first rambling narrative that makes no sense, and is about as interesting as rereading the almanac.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I'd probably &lt;b&gt;lose&lt;/b&gt; money, but the concept is interesting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Anyway, I better go or the &lt;U&gt;quality&lt;/u&gt; of this will go down in that evil downward spiral thing I discussed a few months back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Seeya. I'm back. Wooooo! I's can get to my site again! It was down for a whole day or so 'cause of all the traffic I got from my new quizes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I have an extra-special rant for you all today, to celebrate the new domain name! &lt;a href="http://www.flaming-chickens.com"&gt;www.flaming-chickens.com&lt;/a&gt;! Okay. I am now barophobic (afraid of gravity). I recently learned in my EVIL Physics class that on average, humans lose one inch of height during the day due to gravity pushing on their spine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The height is regained at night, when you're laying down.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This naturally alarmed the HECK out of me! GRAVITY IS EVIL! It's pushing down on me, squishing my spine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>MY SPINE IS SQUISHY! That's is just so extremly creepy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What if, eventually, Earth's gravity get's very very strong, and we all imploud from the squishyness?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It'd be like when you go to the bottom of the ocean, only with gravity instead of pressure...*shudders* Pressure is evil, too. Air pressure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Did you know that there is over two miles of air sitting on you right now? Even though air is light, that much air adds up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>TWO MILES?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even the air is conspiring to squish me!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you don't believe that all that air has weight, try going into space sometime.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Space is notorious for not having air.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When you're in space (without a space suit) you don't SUFFUCATE, you don't FREEZE.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You exploud.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Since all that nifty air isn't pressin' on you, your guts and stuff are free to go wherever they want, and the EVIL little things decide to roam around.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Outside your body.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It's creepy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So...air pressure can be a good thing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even though it gains pleasure from squishing my spine.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That's it, I'm gonna take drastic measures!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I'm gonna launch THE OFFICIAL FLAMING CHICKENS LUNAR COLONY! The moon has one-sixth of Earth's gravity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And absolutly NO air-pressure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We can all wear spiffy space-suits and feel all superiour to all those stupid earthlings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So...if you wish to contribute to this great and magneficent and magestic and MOOSEY project...we need the following things:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>739 rolls of aluminium foil (preferably the extra shiny kind) 417 refridgerator boxes, 9000 rolls of "sticky on both sides" duct tape, 300 lbs of chicken feathers (preferably white) and 1 (one) thermo-nuclear-rocket-thruster.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you can spare any of these items, please e-mail them to me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>E-mail. Did you really think I'd give you guys my ADDRESS?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now...I know what you guys are thinking...some of those items on that list are gonna be hard to find.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Especially that duct tape.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But, believe me, it's MUCH more practical than the alternative.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What is the alternative, you ask?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I'll tell you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Making me(The Patron Saint of Paperclips) the Ruler of the Laws of Nature!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That way I can just outlaw the need for gravity and air pressure!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I'm already half way there, since I conclusivly proved (in Physics class) that gravity actually causes things to slow down and EVENTUALLY GO UP!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sure, my TEACHER said that was because I was doing the problems wrong, but once I'm the Ruler of the Laws of Nature, I'll change the problems so that I'm right!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Oooo! I thought of another very good reason to assist with the Official Flaming Chickens Lunar Colony! As we all know, the world is going to end in about 380,695 days!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This means that we only have a very short while to prepare.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And I sugest that we build the rocket so that we can go to the Official Flaming Chickens Lunar Colony so that we can laugh at the stupid earthlings who are blowing up because they didn't listen to us when we tried to warn them about the impending doom!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Once we are on our Lunar Landing Site, we will engage in many exciting activites, primarily related to suffucating and starving.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If (and this is a big if) the world DOES survive, we can beg them for food, oxygen and other supplies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They'll probably just call us weird and laugh at us, but that's beside the point!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I can even see the Official Flaming Chicken Rocket.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It'll be covered in chicken feathers, and shaped like a chicken.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The foil will make up the beak and the folded legs, and the thruster can simulate the tail.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It will be a truly magestic site, as it launches from the earth, spewing excess oxygen, cardboard, feathers and tape.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But, act now, or it will be too late, and you will be one of the losers that we'll be laughing at, assuming we have air to laugh with.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remember, e-mail psopc@flaming-chickens.com the much needed supplies...if that is possible.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If not, then some day, when the Internet is down and I'm really bored, I will construct a model OFCR and attempt to launch it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That will be a wonderous day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think I'll get my little sister to be the test piolet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Well...better go...I need to plan this out more...I'm back. And mildly weirded-out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My dad...was on this site.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My dad.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It even SOUNDS weird.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He took the TAB member quiz and turned out to be me, he took the JOB quiz, and was a repo man (which had a pic of my brother) He said he wanted to see what I was doing, and to make sure that I wasn't saying anything derrogatory about my parents.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He looked me upvia yahoo's search engine using flaming-chicken as the keyword.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It took him to my quiz page.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So he probably didn't see the majority of my site.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It's just weird.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All along, my entire family has scoffed (nifty word, isn't it?) about my site, and called me weird.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I dunno...I guess I'm just kinda freaked out. Oh, and don't forget to celebrate Mad Hatter Day on October the 6th. Seeya.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I'm back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I had some conspriacy or another to rant about.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But then I listened to some of the new &lt;a href="music.html"&gt;music&lt;/a&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I put on my site and mellowed out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I can't remember what I was gonna rant about.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Oh, yeah.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now I do.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Purified" water. Just wait a sec while I stop the music. *content sigh* There we go...that's much better. Now I can think.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That's right, folks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Purified" water.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now...just stop a second and contemplate that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Pure means, well, no extra stuff.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>100% of something.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Right?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Well, next time you buy your $3 FREAKIN' dollar bottle of water, consider this.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>On almost all the "purified" water bottles I've ever seen it has the following mesage: "Purified through reverse osmosis.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Minerals added for a pure, fresh taste."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In other words, they take all that extra "stuff" out to make it pure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then they add other "stuff" in to make it TASTE pure.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But it's not.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For all you, the uninformed consumer, could know, it might have rat poison in it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Pure" water manufactuerers are not required to list the ingredients of water, because the average consumer believes that it should be obvious.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But that is false!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They add random minerals to our water to make it taste better, and then advertise it as pure! It's an outrage! I'd rather drink the "impure" tap water where at least I KNOW that someone, somewhere tested it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It's a law, I think.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But does anyone test "pure" water? Most likely they test it BEFORE they add the extra stuff..."Yep, Bob, this is some mighty pure water." "Yep, Bill, time to dump the arsnic in so it tastes pure!" What kind of reasoning is that?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Wouldn't pure water TASTE pure, and impure water TASTE impure? The insanity and stupidity is mind boggling!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That's why I like fast-food salt.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It actually lists what random minerals they through in to make it TASTE like salt.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There's salt, of course, and aluminum sulfate, and other compounds.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But the point is, if I were, say, freakily allergic to a random mineral, I could read the ingredients and not eat the salt.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That's what they need to do with the water.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or, at the very least, not label it as "pure".<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Okay.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That's the rant of the week, month, year, whatever.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I'll probably have another one soon, but that whole water thing has been buggin me for awhile.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Well...seeya!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Er...yeah...I'm back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It's been awhile, (at least two weeks) since I've written here.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I've been obsessed with various webcomics, creating the stupidly long new Phobia Quiz and being maniacly hysterical about my site always being down due to bandwith issues.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I'm goin' light on the advertising at the moment, which is why I'm free to write here.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I WANT to write. But I can't think of anything to write about. Typical.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I finnaly get some free time to rant and rave and all my topics just magically melted away.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Let's see...what have I ranted about before, subliminal messages, vast breakfast cereal conspiracies, water, uh...reality tv? And that's just what I can list from memory. Oh, yeah! How could I forget the stupid Tootsie Roll Pop Commercials?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>TACO is still in my heart.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>*sighs*...now...let's see...what to rant about today... ... ... ... ... I can't think of anything!? Is this writer's block?! Or maybe I just wanna go to bed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sleeping is fun.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Well...let's see.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Did you know that statistics prove that 45% of all statistics are completly made up by me (The Patron Saint of Paperclips)? Well...they are.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ha! I see you have no reaction to that, do you Hypothetical Reader? I have once again caused that explody sensation in your brain meats! You cannot DEFEAT me! I rule the...er...*random Loyal Minion whispers in ear* That's right! I rule the Internet! The Official FLaming-Chickens Handbook already confirms that fact! You CANNOT DENY it!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It says that in black and...er lime green! It MUST be true! Because it is in those veyr colors that the &lt;u&gt;Matrix&lt;/u&gt; is programmed! Ahhh...I see your confusion! You cannot follow the vast, mind-boggling logic that is ME! Wait...how...how can I BE logic? That doesn't make any sense...you can't BE something abstract...can you? Now MY brain meats feel explody.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That's not fair! I see your EVIL plot now, Hypothetical Reader! You just let me rant on and on for you KNEW that eventually I would confuse myself with my vast puddle of knowledge.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You are devious...I give you that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Unfortunantly...I must leave...before the confusion spreads and I do something stupid...like revealing my one weakness before you...THAT'S IT! Code 452 of the Flaming Chickens Handbook states that the Patron Saint of Paperclips (ME!!!) does not, has never, and will absolutly NOT admit to having any weakness...besides the aformention indivduals own skin, which isn't even a weakness anyway since no representative of the Dark, Fluffier Side can BE the Patron Saint of Paperclips (Guess, who...no...no...THAT'S IT!) and even if they could it wouldn't do them any good because it would scare them instead of the aformentioned individual.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Boy...I really enjoy confusing myself!:) Seeya! I'm baaaaa-ack! Aren't you happy? Here, see if you can find the super-secret message! &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wh&lt;font color="#FF0000"&gt;i&lt;/font&gt;le</p>

I'm back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And I've realized that I am a complete idiot.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For an ENTIRE MONTH I have possesed the arcane knowledge, but I forgot to share it with you, my loyal potentially imaginary reader.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I know.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You're shocked at my selfish, bad, memory.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I apologize from the depths of my moosey soul.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For, you see...my life long goal has been fufilled...*anticipatory silence*...&lt;I&gt;THERE ACTUALLY IS GRAPE PIE!!!!&lt;/I&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I know...you are as shocked as I am.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One day I was randomly looking up images via &lt;a href="http://www.google.com"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;...and 'lo and behold, there it was.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Grape Pie.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was as if it had been just sitting there...waiting for me to discover it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Apparantly Grape Pie isn't mainstream, but it has existed for some time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In obscure cookbooks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Well...that just makes me filled with gooey happiness.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of course, there is also regret...after all, I could have made a &lt;b&gt;fortune&lt;/b&gt; if I'd been the first to think of it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Oh, well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was something else I had to tell you loyal *cricket chirps, someone coughs* fans.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I can't remember what.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I guess I'll just rant and rave about that whole vicious downward spiral of my writing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I mean, I KNOW people are coming here...I have proof! *holds up a piece of paper, which, from a distance, appears to have writing on it* Yes, undenyable proof! But this proof degrades this mysterious, mystical and mystifying "quality" of my words.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After all, how can I be self derisive, and full of low expectations for this site if I KNOW people are here...several thousand of them in fact, in just a few months.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It's strange.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I felt more fufilled when this site was a barren wastland of useless space.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But, if it had remained that way, I would have had no impetus to continue my pointlessly insane ranting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Oh, speaking of insane, I STILL need those much needed supplies for the Official Flaming-Chickens Lunar Colony! No one has even bothered to e-mail them to me...*sniffle*.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I needs the duct tape! How can I survive without the sticky goodness? HOW, I ask you!? It cannot be...hmmmm...maybe I should just use IMAGINARY duct tape...it's easier to come by ,but it's much more expensive...I'm not sure what to do. *enter Squirell*<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What's that, little Squirell? That's just silly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You KNOW I ran out of imaginary money last week when I bought that imaginary country.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>WHAT!?

I won't be able to feed my various imaginary pets and friends their beloved imaginary food! Squirell?

You don't know who Squirell is? You haven't been paying attention have you? She's my little puppy...she fears grape flavored stuff, wind, rain, television, noise, silence, small children and pretty much everything.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She likes sniffing potentially dangerous stuff, like electrical sockets.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Surely you have heard of her? Still no? Oh, well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You know...I enjoy having these conversations with you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It really lets me get to know you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What's that? You say I'm really just talking to myself? What an eccentric idea! To think, YOU are trying to tell ME that YOU aren't here.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How absurd.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After all, I'm talking to you, aren't I? *nods* Well, yeah...I KNOW I'm actually typing instead of talking.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Wait a minute...so you're saying that I'm talking and responding to you, but you won't be reading this until long after I have finished typing? Now who's the crazy one? For that theory to work, I'd have to be psychic...or in possesion of a freaky time-traveling computer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because what you're saying is that I'm talking to people in the future.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That my words somehow travel accross time (if only a few minutes) and are somehow picked up by future you, and that my responses are dictated by future you's reactions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What? You mean that I'm just randomly responding regardless of your reactions?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Why, that would be insane, wouldn't it? That's the point you're trying to get across? *pauses* Oh.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I see.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You wanna play that way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Well...two can play by THOSE rules.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You wanna try to convince me I'M crazy? Well, look at you? How do you know I even exist? For all you know you could be staring at that freaky 3-D maze screen saver with a blank look on your face while you THINK you're reading an inhumanly long text.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For all you know, you could be halucinating my entire site! For that matter, how do you know that ANYTHING but you exists!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You could be floating out in empty space, conjuring nice little fantasies to relieve the monotony of being the only living being! Every single person you know could just be figments of your imagination, you could even be in a crazy house! Not only that, but how do you know that YOU actually exist? You could be the figment of someone else's dream.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What would happen when that dreamer woke? Are you happy? You got me started.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I may NEVER shut up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I'll just go on and on about how crazy you COULD be.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All because YOU tried to convince me that I was crazy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>*blinks* And I STILL can't remember what else I was gonna say to you people.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Strange, huh? Well, I better leave before I go on and on about more "reality" theories. Makes you wonder about "reality" television, huh? Seeya. I'm back. Grrrr...I had a nifty rant all planned out in my head.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And then I was unable to get on the computer and I forgot most of it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Oh, but I did remember what else I wanted to say to you people.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remember that rant I did on how there could be a secret camera in the smoke detector? I few months ago I saw a movie about that. It was pretty good.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Maybe I'd seen it before, and that's where I got the idea.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I forgot it's name.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Well...I DO have a special treat for you weirdos who apparantly like wasting time! Today, in my (Honors) English class, we did group work.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My group...well...we either went hysterical or crazy, I can't decide which.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We had to do an essay on a book.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was a sample essay online. It sucked.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It tooked about envelooping (enveloping) cracked nuts and parables.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So we were already off to a bad start.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here is the sum total of my group's work. (Note: I wrote virtually none of this, so I cannot be blamed, credited with any of this.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Lots of death, lots and lots of death in this section.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Death is like life in that after you die some things start life again inside of you.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>'Ah the power of cheese!' The author's vision was unique in that only he put biscuits and death in the same sentence. 'I found nothing else to do but to offer him on of my good Swede's ship's biscuits I had in my pocket'" And we're supposed to be GOOD in English! We KNEW how terrible it was, but we just didn't bother to change it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Especially the part about the biscuits and cheese. We just picked random words in the selection and wrote about them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was sad.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In any case, I hope you enjoyed our patheticness.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Seeya!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I'm back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Today I will be mercifully brief.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am here to bring AWARNESS to your moosey soul!

Sure, some of this "fasion" stuff is cool and all, but all it shows is that you had the three and three-quarters brain cells required to copy someone else's "look".<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And don't even get me started on earrings.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My little, eviler sister got her ears pierced when she was relativly younger.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My mom did it to her because it was free.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>OF FREAKIN' COURSE IT WAS FREE! Just like thos so called "diet supplements" that give you a "free" sample because they know that once you try it, you'll like it so much you'll spend oodles of cash on it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(There's probably drugs in it).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Anyway, like the "diet supplement" people, the earring manufacturers KNOW that once they pierce you, you'll be hooked for life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>*pauses* *groans* I'm sorry for that pun (pierced, hooked, getit?). AS soon as you're pierced, you have to buy "starter" earrings. Then you'll need an "extra" pair...for special occasions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Before you know it you'll realize that you need Christmas earrings, Halloween earrings, Valentine's Day earrings, St. Patrick's Day earrings, for crying out loud!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You'll wear these "festive" earings for about a day and then abandon them in some dark cranny of your closet because you simply &lt;u&gt;can't&lt;/u&gt; wear the same earrings two years in a row for heaven's sake!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;u&gt;Then&lt;/u&gt; you'll see these cute little "days-of-the-week" earrings at the mall, and you'll just &lt;u&gt;have&lt;/u&gt; to get a few sets, just in case you lose some.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By the time you're eighty, you'll have enough ear jewelry to open up your own jewelry shop.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of course, you won't want to do that becuase you &lt;u&gt;still&lt;/u&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>need more earrings so people won't think you wear the same ones over and over again.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When I think of how much money people WASTE on appearences, it makes me feel like projectile vomiting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If that's not a vast conspiracy, then nothing on this Earth is.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now, I'm not speaking from personal experience here.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No one I know is that obsessed with earrings, it was just an example.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Although my mother does have a "earring tree".) Sure, certain members of my family &lt;b&gt;do&lt;/b&gt; pay WAY to much attention to fasion, but that's just because of the expectations of society.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I, being weird, am pretty much immune to such expectations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Except those specially formulated for weird-o's like me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If I were to suddenly convert this entrie site into a *shudders* Backstreet Boys fan site or something, you wouldn't be any more suprised than I would be if my brother woke up one day and suddenly realized that he's shallow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It's the same concept.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(No, I don't like any of those creepy "pop" stars.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think that they should routinly die a slow, savage, agonizing death...I was just saying a random thing that I would never, ever do.)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Well...any way...seeya!</p>
<p class="p1">I'm back. And today's rant is a sort of philosophical one.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It's about the (supposedly) infinite nature of the universe.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Suprised? It's spiffy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You see, if the universe is indeed infinite, that means that literally EVERYTHING is possible, and in fact, is happening somewhere in the universe.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Think about it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No matter how unlikely something is, if the universe is infinite, it's happening an infinite number of times.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Think about that old saying about "If you gave an infinite number of monkeys an infinite number of typewriters, eventually they would reproduce the entire works of Shakespear".<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That makes complete and total sense!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Anyone just randomly typing letters will eventually accidently write a word, right? Now think of 100 people typing randomly.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You figure that one of those 100 people would actually have a coherent phrase. And one out of a million people would probably have a few sentences.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So if you have an infinite number of people, some are going to have entire &lt;u&gt;books&lt;/u&gt; of coherent stuff.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And, you have to remember that because infinity &lt;u&gt;is&lt;/u&gt; infinite, you can divide it an infinite number of times.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Try it. If you have a decent graphing calculator, plug in the infinity symbol divided by anything, (even infinity).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The answer is still infinity. Using my philosopy, that EVERYTHING exists because the universe is infinite...well...think about it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In some far off world, there are pokemon...there are an evil race of muffin like creatures, there is a world with ABSOLUTLY NO COMMERCIALS DURING TELEVISION! I know, unlikely, huh? But somewhere, it exists.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Think about it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the universe is infinite it would be crazy to think that we're alone.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>With an infinite universe, there are infinite possibilites.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There ARE aliens.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not only that, but there are an infinite number of different kinds of intelligent life.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Which means that there are an infinite number of worlds with humanoid life. (Think of the fake-looking Star Trek aliens).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If there are an infinte number of worlds with human life, than there are an infinte number of worlds that have someone exactly like you, with only a few key differences.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Like alternate dimensions and stuff) So, there is a world where you are the creator of this Longest Text Ever.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There is a world where you are a faerie.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There is a world where you were never born.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There is a world where you are a slave to your TOASTER OVEN.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The possibilities are literally endless.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Every fantasy the human mind has concieved exist at some place in the universe.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There are an infinite number of worlds with Harry Potter.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Think about it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I came up with this philosophy when I was in fifth grade.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I'd tell it to my little brother as a bed time story.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He always enjoyed it because it meant that somewhere, he was the Supreme Dictator of the Galaxy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That made him happy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He ignored the fact that he was also a 72 year old "sanitation engineer" somewhere.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>All the good possibilities effectivly cancel out the bad ones, leaving the sum total of you and your counterparts experiences as nothing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You don't have the best life of your counterparts, but you don't have the worst either.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because that would be impossible. There is &lt;b&gt;always&lt;/b&gt; someone worse off and better off than you. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because there are an infinite number of people on either side of the spectrum.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Confusing, huh? But that's the kind of thing I like.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That also explains why normal stuff confuses me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I'm sure some so called "scientist" can prove all my theories wrong...but how? How do you PROVE something is not infinite? You'd have to find the end, of course.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But how, may I ask, can you find the end of the FREAKIN' universe? What, is there a giant sign saying, "DEAD END"?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The universe is EVERYTHING, how can it end? At the same time, how can you prove something IS infinite? You could travel in a straight line at the speed of light for a million years and all you'd prove is that the universe is really, really big.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But you'd never prove it was infinite.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How could you? Our mind's cannot conceive of the vastness of infinity.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We'd probably go crazier.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In any case, my theory means that playing video games is very cruel.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Why, you ask? Because in some world, the video game is real.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So when you kill, or whatever, in the game, you are actually ending life somewhere in the universe. Of course, you also end life by sneezing, eating, sleeping, and watching T.V.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>According to my theory that everything is real.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of course, if everything is real...then the Universe is pretty contradictory.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The paradox of my system of beliefs leads me to believe that the universe, in fact, is not infinite.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because nature supposidly abhors a paradox.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Although, as I said, there's no way to prove me wrong OR right.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That's what I like about making abstract theories...<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Anyway, sorry for the lack of relative weirdness, conspiracy theories and doughnuts (my Moose ate them all).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Well...now that I think about it...according to my theory, ALL conspiracies are real and mislabled "paranoid" people are really the only ones who see the truth.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>*blinks* Wow...so I'm NOT paranoid.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Who'da thought it? Well...better go before one of my two and half sane readers falls asleep:)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Seeya! I'm back! Boy, are you mythical, mystical readers in for a treat, today!

Pikachu!"...a pokemon game.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I'll only say that it was the first game you could "talk" to and was the first (and only) N64 virtual pet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Pikachu...well...he didn't like me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I gave him cupcakes, and presents, and did everything I could to befriend him! And what did he do to me? He snuck up on me one day in our room (in the game) with a sword! That's right, a sword! He tried to kill me! I heard something and turned around, and there he was! He even tried to hide the sword behind his back! When I tried to talk to him, he tossed it away nonchalantly and pretended he hadn't heard me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then he preceeded to trash my room, scattering kleenex everywhere. I'm pretty sure that the "smelly yellow ball" that he started throwing was his own feces (poo). That dirty little rat.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Awwww...isn't he cute? Hmmmm...I suppose I should clarify that the Pikachu game was 3-D and your character was in first person mode(you see through character's eyes). Otherwise you'd think I was delusional, or something. Everyone I know who has played that game is shocked when I tell them...oh, well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Speaking of virtual pets, I'm revamping the ones on this site.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I've finnally figured out sorta, maybe, kinda, how to do stuff to make it more real.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Anyway, seeya! OOooooo! I'm back, and I had yet another Asparagus War with some people.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We made a guild, and I wrote out the transcripts of the first ever Asparagus War in narrative form (mock epic, very cheesey) Since it's very, very long, I'll post it here to meet my imaginary word quota for the day! Oh, and all those weird squiggly lines and symbols, those are supposed to be apostrophes, but neopet's code is weird, and I'm not gonna bother to edit it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Enjoy!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;i&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">And, on the 15th day of the Month of August, in the year of our Lord 2003, at approximately 7:52 p.m. a great and wondrous battle was fought in the waste lands of the General Chat Room.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>â€˜Lo, and eon337 did wield the mighty Swiss-Asparagus,<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and did attempt to vanquish her foe, the Evil and Fluffy preggypreggy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Preggypreggy had tamed the fearsome Asparagus Sword, and many a foe had she slain with her valor.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But behold! For the Swiss-Asparagus did slice, and dice and was capable of turning itself into julienne fries!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And so it seemed that the two mighty warriors were evenly matched and that their struggle would never come to and end. They didst charge at each other with a terrible noise and clamor, and the skies did shake and the earth did tremble at the ferocity of their mighty blows!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The stereotypical Asparagus Sword didst fail to hit its mark and eon337 did mock the Sword for itâ€™s falling. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/i&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">Translation: On 8-15-03, 7:52 NST, eon337 and preggypreggy grabbed some Asparagus Themed weapons and fought.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They made fun of each otherâ€™s weapons, and generally kept missing each other every time they swung. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;hr&gt;&lt;i&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">And eon337 did think long and ponderous and in so doing converted the puny Swiss-Asparagus into the mighty and powerful toothpick.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And the masses did gleam the significance of this act and they were awed by the grace and cunning of the wooden speck.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And preggypreggy was immune to the verbal slings and arrows of her foe, and refused to be disheartened by eon337â€™s dishonorable insults.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her claim being that function of a weapon<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>is to be put before the ornate form.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She endeavored to thwart eon337â€™s plans to defeat her with the great and wondrous toothpick.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She didst again pummel the air with her sword, but in her enthusiasm her blows didst fall far from their mark.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And the masses didst cheer for eon337 as she had impressed them greatly and they made the sounds of impressive wonder.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/i&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Translation: Eon337 turned a perfectly good Swiss-Asparagus into a toothpick to gain the approval of the studio audience. The audience oooed and awed. <span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Preggypreggy continued to swing wildly around, missing each time.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She ignored eon337â€™s insult and said that at least her sword worked. &lt;hr&gt;&lt;i&gt;</p>
<p class="p1">And then a new challenger didst arrive at the arena and scoobychick6900 didst fling bowls of asparagus at the fighting mortal enemies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Preggypreggy appealed to the masses, but to no avail, and was heartily surprised when the asparagus did hit her.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And â€˜Lo! The masses didst condemn scoobychick6900 loudly and vehemently and there was much rejoicing in the land.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Preggypreggy didst fancy that she had perhaps met scoobychick6900 previously, and so did attempt to recollect when.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Eon337 did take advantage of the lull in action and did attack preggypreggy with her finger.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Preggypreggy did retaliate with the awe-inspiring SuperPoke, and<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>eon337 was laid low upon the ground in agony.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;/i&gt;&lt;hr&gt;</p>

<p class="p1">And with victory in her mighty vision, preggypreggy didst decide to reveal her secret weapon, and with a fancy hand movement, revealed the extent of her traitorous ways.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For all know that the bagels and the doughnuts didst disband in ancient times of old. Preggypreggy, through her treacherous methods, had obtained the Flying Doughnut of Doom and didst endeavor to use it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Eon337 was readily prepared for such an occurrence and didst arm herself with mighty ear-shields, armor that didst repel all projectiles of metal, a head covering, and an outer covering of strange, transparent material that didst snap whence it was squeezed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Aragorns_cutie then didst show up with the almighty nemesis broccoli and an unnecessary sneer upon her countenance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>_Radical_girl_ did break the protocol and didst claim to rather fight with cucumbers, and so it was done.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And the masses rejoiced.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And eon337 didst not hear the newcomers because of her mighty ear-shields, and didst offer the fighters dressings for their wounds.</p>

<p class="p1">&lt;i&gt;Hiya. This is not PSOPC today. This is PSOCB (Patron Saint of Carbonated Beverages). We are the two original Head Saints, but for some reason, she gets all the attention. Guess I should get out of bed once in a while huh. Originally, I thought up the whole Patron Saints of the Order of the Flaming Chicken (when I should have been taking notes in Trig), but PSOPC is more creative and she elaborated on it more so. I was drawing "suppressed rage in bunny form" comics then and didn't care. I must say, she's gotten very good at thinking randomy thoughts, whereas, I'm just stoopid and something dumb pops out of my brain like floppy bacon from a toaster. I drank half a bottle of soy sauce today just to see if it gave me x-ray vision, but alas, I had nothing I wanted to look through (okay, I'm lying. I drank the whole thing on a dare.). By the way, soy sauce is gross. Who invented it? --"Why gee whiz, Bert! I think we should mix soy beans with water and have chinese for lunch!!"--"Why, indubitoubly Samson! Not only will it taste like crap, we'll get the runs!!!"-- If you don't know what the "runs" are, consult old people, like my dad. If you are in high school or college and have a job, this works great. When I call in sick (when I'm sick of working, not actually sick), I always have nosey bosses who want to know exactly what my symptoms are and how bad. I found a way to make them not WANT to know. I told my sister to try it once and it worked for her too. You just call up work, use a very retarded, slow, lisping voice when you say this: --"Weeelllllllll, I woked up this mornin' with a terrible headache so I took some aspirin with theraflu. By the way, those don't mix too good, now I have a tummy ache, my nose is runny and bleedin', my spleen feels like its gonna 'splode, I'm a tad gassy, and I got the RUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNZZZZZZZZZZZ!!!-- At this point, you'll want to use an annoying high-pitched growly voice (think drunk Barney from The Simpsons after sucking helium balloons), raspberry a few times with your toungue and hang up. I have much to do now, so thus ends this portion of my guest rant. I'll probably want to do this a few more times just because I can. Weeee Bye now!<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">&lt;/i&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I bet you, loyal *hmmm...I don't want a cricket...maybe a nice annoying gnat or something...okay...instead of the cricket...* readers can't wait for the next time I don't rant! Right? Weeeellll...I DO have a topic for today...a topic so wonderful that it will also be included in the next OFCEM!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What is this magical topic, you ask? Why, opposite day, of course!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You see...er...well...how should I begin? Opposite day is, of course a day in which everything you say means the exact opposite.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is practiced (informally) by many elementary schoolers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I honor this er...honored tradition.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But, to my dismay, I discovered a fatal flaw with opposite day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By my reasoning...it COULD NOT EXIST! Yes...I know...blasphemy, right? But it could not be disputed.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If you were to tell someone that it WAS opposite day they would have to take the opposite of what you just said which would mean that it WASN'T opposite day. And, of course, if you were to tell someone that it WASN'T opposite day there would be no reason for them to take the opposite of what you said and so it still WOULDN'T be opposite day! Confusing, huh?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But I have now seen the light! The answer to this moral dilema has been so neatly resolved, by Jesse.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He is er...well...I'm not sure how old...but he is in the third grade.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He is either a genius...or really weird like me (Come on, be honest...how many of you random people have put any though into opposite day...or even know about it?)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He said that to make it opposite day...*dramatic pause in which the PSOPC stares into space vacantly*...all you had to do was say that it would be opposite day in 5 seconds! PURE GENIUS! Since it is not yet opposite day, you don't have to take the opposite of the statement and so can take it at face value! Do you care, Loyal *gnat/cricket sound* Reader? *stunned* You don't!? Why ever not!? It is the most important discovery since...since...er...since...GRAVITY! (Although it is evil and squishying my spine...)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How can you remain apathatic at a time like this!? The fate of mankind has been forever altered!

I'm back! Seeing how I will shortly no longer be (legally) a child, I have decided to rant about: adults.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You cannot deny it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They are EVIL.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Think about it! Come, on! Don't be shy!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I'm serious.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When you think of the evil, conniving, conspiratorial ways of adults, what's the first thing to come to mind?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The nursery rhyme, 'Mary Had a Little Lamb', right?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Huh? You mean it's NOT!?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How...bizzare, it's obviously a mechanism for brain-washing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Anyway, here's MY reasoning for hating the song (and many, many others).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Mary Had A Little Lamb makes children resigned to accepting punishment that they don't deserve! You still do not see!? Fine, I shall elaborate.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This poor little girl's lamb (with fleece as white as snow--an obvious reference to &lt;u&gt;seeming&lt;/u&gt; purity) follows her to school one day (which was, oddly enough, against the rules).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The kids at school, who were not used to seeing a lamb at school, started to "laugh and play" and basically act like wild animals.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now (this is all speculation) I am 90% sure that the final verse (which neither I, nor anyone I asked know) deals with the teacher reprimanding poor little Mary in some way.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And for what!?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The kid's pet followed her to school!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How could she stop it, she probably never even thought to look behind her!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not only that, but poor little Mary would never, EVER do such a thing on purpose!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just listen to the SONG for cryin' out loud!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The lamb followed HER! She didn't LEAD it!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now, sure, the teacher was probably on her last nerve.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I mean, she's an ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She probably doesn't get paid much, or gain much respect from her pupils.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So, when the children pretty much went wild over the lamb, and she couldn't calm them, she was looking for someone to blame.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And poor little Mary was a ripe target by then.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now, can you honestly picture poor little Mary arguing with her teacher?

<p class="p1">Yep.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I'm back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>*traumatic pause* This weekend I went to go visit my future college.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was the most traumatizing experience of my life, to date. The day before I got there the college had won a basketball game and were going to the finals.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This naturally caused parties to break out all over campus.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>According to one guy, a couch was "set on fire".<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>*sigh*<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was "hosted" (along with two other girls) by some bubbly, perky Greek (sorority (sp?)) girl.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I hate her so much. She never shut up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She was so shallow.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She wanted us to join a sorority, just like her. (all paraphrased) Ex. 1 "I would NEVER have passed my classes if I hadn't gone Greek". Ex. 2 "I just don't see HOW I would have, like, ya' know, managed ANYTHING without my sisters!"<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If I never see her again it will be too soon.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Her idea of entertainment was to take us to the recreational center, sit us down in the gym and talk to her friends while watching the guys (badly, this IS an engineering school after all) attempt to play basketball. Apparantly all the decent players were at the final game thingy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then she took us to the fraternity next to her house (we didn't even get to "experience" sleeping in an actual dorm).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The fraternity was disgusting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There must have been 1000 flies, 100 beer bottles, 50 Bud Lite cans, and 5 creepy dudes who were attempting to practice music for some competition.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After about three hours of this, I almost snapped.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Me and another girl were supposed to be watching T.V., but due to the evil, out of tune, incredibly loud band, this proved to be impossible.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My "host" and the girl who was enthusiastic about "going Greek" were swimming in a heated pool.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The other girl (who also hated to swimn) and I started to talk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There was nothing else really to do.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She hated our host and hated the fraternity/Greek thing too.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We talked for awhile, and some dude joined us.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was cool.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He was regional STAR student for another area.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Somehow we got onto the topic of religion, and it turned out that the other girl I was with was Muslim, and was born in Egypt.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was cool.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Anyway, it was just the two of us girls in the entire FREAKIN' fraternity (not counting the two swiming girls, downstairs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The floor was greasy, and oddly sticky--just like a movie theater.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When our "host" finnally said we could go, it was close to 2 a.m.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I barely got any sleep...grrr...not to mention the fact that we had walk to breakfast by 8:00 a.m.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Oh.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Silly me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I forgot to mention a key difficulty.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We had to WALK EVERYWHERE!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Uphill!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(But not in the freezing snow, for 15 miles).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You have not experinced Jenny's personal Hell untill you have carried your luggage (including a trash bag containing a sleeping back and the trash bags plastic handley-thingies are rapidly stretching out to become lethal weapons similar to piano wire) uphill, upstairs, across campus and up the four or five flights to the breakfast area, only to discover that, Oh! Gee, there was an ELEVATOR that the "host" conviently forgot to mention.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even more evil stuff happened, but suffice it to say that when I finally saw my dad at lunch, I begged him to just skip the final sessions because they were pointless (how to choose your major) and go home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He went ahead with his sessions, but let me opt out of mine and I slept for 50 minutes on some random couch in the lobby.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Oh.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And then the 6 hour drive home. *shudders*</p>
<p class="p1">As you can tell, I am still seriously miffed about the whole experience.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sorry for ranting...</p>
<p class="p1">Well...there WAS some good things about the whole experience. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">For one thing, it was the first time I'd ever been in a big city.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The sky line was beautiful!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Er...yeah...that was about it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Did I mention the uphill walking part?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I did?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Oh.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I guess I'm done.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Seeya!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I'm back!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And I'm here with a Vital Public Service Anouncment for all of my two and a half Loyal, Hypothetical Readers!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Don't you feel all special inside?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Oh.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Yeah.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The anouncment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>BEWARE OF YOUR OWN FRENCH FRIES.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That's correct.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>French fries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You see, it all started one friday afternoon *start wavy flashback sequence*<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My friends and I were sitting down to a tasty lunch of Skool Brand food.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This included, tragically, french fries.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Oh, what a fateful day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It seems like it was only yesterday when we were so carefree and innocent...when in fact it was actually only a few hours ago.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You see, we inadvertantly started a mini-food fight that spilled over into a neighboring table, which also housed our friends.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Said friends began flingning the aformentioned French Fries at us.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I shudder to think of how we had laughed and frolicked and otherwise remained oblivious to the tragedy that had yet to unfold.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For, you see...the french fires were...pointy...and hard.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And Fate herself seemed to conspire against us (just like the Skool, government, evil cartoon owl, etc.)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One single solitary french fry pierced my friend's guard and hit her on the nose with the sharpest, hardest tip a french fry has ever been known to produce.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We calmed down, and thought nothing of our near brush with Death.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After all, what can a FREAKIN' FRENCH FRY do, right? Ahhh...to be so young and naive again.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Time passed, as it always does, and &lt;a href="aboutmeg.html"&gt;"Meg"&lt;/a&gt; noticed a speck of something on our friend who had been hit by the projectile french fry. The friend (Tonileigh, actually) wiped the speck, only to discover that it was blood.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>THE FRENCH FRY HAD DRAWN BLOOD! It was obviously an evil, voodoo french fry sent to assasinate her by the mysteriously evil Cafeteria Lunch Ladies who needed Tonileigh's blood for their accursed voodoo spells.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Fortunatly, the quick thinking of &lt;a href="aboutmeg.html"&gt;"Meg"&lt;/a&gt; saved us all and the lunch ladies never obtained their goal.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Oh. And here is yet ANOTHER VERY, VERY, VERY IMPORTANT PUBLIC SERVICE THINGY.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Tag, you're it!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These words have haunted nearly ever playground in existance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Tag" is practically all a child learns in kindergarten.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There is not a person alive who has not played some version of the game.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And yet...what, exactly is "it"?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When defining it for my &lt;a href="pronounquiz.html"&gt;Pronoun Quiz&lt;/a&gt; I reffered to "it" as something that "mankind has dreaded for centuries".<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What made me say such a thing.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What is it about the unknown, mysterious and faintly ominous "it" that makes people dread it so much?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even the most innocent of children know that to be "it" is to be a virtual outcast of society.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The youngest child knows that no sane person would want to be "it".<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Recently a group of TAB members, myself included, set about finding out what "it" exactly is.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We conducted "field research" (we played a game of tag).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>When I became "it" I declared that I was touching the bench I was standing on so it became "it" and the bench was touching the ground, and the ground was touching everything on earth, except for airplanes and stuff but even the ground was touching AIR which was touching more air and so on and so on untill the very AIR was touching the airplanes and the airplanes became "it".<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So...the entire earth has actually been "it" from the first game of tag and WE JUST NEVER KNEW IT! I know, I'm just as shocked as you, Hypothetical Reader.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>*shakes head* And all along we had thought that we could somehow absolve ourselves of the burden of being "it" simply by passing it on to another.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But that is not true.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We merely pass the &lt;I&gt;awareness of being "it" on&lt;/i&gt; but never the actual quality of being "it".<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The question was raised: Where did the first "it" on Earth come from.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was a thought provoking question.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some thought that perhaps the first person to invent tag was the original "it".<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I, however, favored an extraterristrial origin.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My current theory is that the meteor that supposidly killed off the dinosaurs was the original "it", and that it "tagged" the earth, thereby causeing the earth to be "it".<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The dinosaurs, of course, could not handle the burden of being "it" which resulted in mass suicides.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The mammals, being nothing but idiot rodents at the time, couldn't care less about being "it" and eventually forgot all about it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Until, that is, some half-remembered special memory popped out of some five year old's brain and he/she invented tag.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Some people found holes in my theory:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How did the meteor become "it"?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After much discussion and deliberation, we came to a group consensus that the so called "Big Bang" was actually all the players of the game scattering.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Similar to the beggining of a game of tag or hide-n-go-seek.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The players begin huddled together, but when the game starts they scatter and flee from the person/planet/rock who is "it".<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The only difference I can think of is that rather than passing the "it"ness on, the players merely add to the number of people who are already "it".<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My theory would also account for the current scientific opinion that the planets/galaxy/universe is moving away from the origin point of the Big Bang.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After all, if there's no base, why return to where you started?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You wanna put as much distance between you and your pursuers as possible.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Critics wanted to go further, was anyone "it" BEFORE the Big Bang.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>My arguement is this:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>No one is "it" before you begin a game.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Any "it" before the Big Bang was part a seperate game, and would therefore be considered a different "it" from the "it" that we fear so much.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So I believe the question to be a moot point.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>*blinks* What's that, Loyal Reader?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I have confused you with my trivalties?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You do not understand my obsession with "it"?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Shame on you, Reader!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Haven't you learned yet that it's my JOB to confuse you and make no sense?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Tsk-Tsk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Oh, well.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Gotta go! I'm back, but only for about five seconds.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just a little side note here:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Remember that rant I did about "pure" water?

A hundreth of a percente of the salt was potassium iodide!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You can't get much more accurate than that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Don't you think that "pure" water has much MORE than 0.01% of some random mineral?

I'm back!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And I have yet another footnote to a previous rant!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You remember that "infinite possibilities" rant?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Here's a quote from a supposed &lt;a href="http://www.johntitor.com/"&gt;Time Traveler&lt;/a&gt;:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Every possible thing that can happen or will happen has already happened somewhere."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I love it! Here's another one:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"On a philosophical level, the existence of multiple worlds implies a moral balance in the superverse. For every worldline you perform a good action, there is a worldline where you perform a bad action. There are no good and bad people, just good and bad decisions.

Ah, the power of cheese! Think about it: they are trying to sub-consciously tell you that THEY hold the power...of CHEEESE! And there are few things more powerful than THAT! Plus, the so-called "dairy farmer's of America" who pay for the Cheese commercials OBVIOUSLY have a virtual monopoly on the whole dairy thing. They even require that cheese get that little "real cheese" stamp before anyone considers it to be REAL cheese. Have you ever tasted fake cheese?&lt;/i&gt;<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Anyway, my point is that it is getting increasingly harder to find the time to make new quizzes, (or add pics to that destiny quiz), and to make coherent entries into this longest text ever.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>*sniffle*<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I try, though!<span

text read:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Different People Differnt Tastes.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Okay.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I could easily see what it was TRYING to say:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There is something for EVERYONE at Subway (eat fresh).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But my very first thought was:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Whoa, hey, are they CANNIBALS!?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Because I interpretted it to mean that different people TASTED differnt,

well, quite frankly, people are mostly contacting me about PSOPC bot, the OFCEM or the Quizzes, and *sniffle* mostly ignoring this little (note the irony) page.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Well, seey later!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I'm back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And, for the first time in quite some time, I am truly pissed off...and this

class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>NEVERMIND the fact that I've worked at the daycare for A WHOLE YEAR, just so I wouldn't have to work for my final Summer of Freedom.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Apparantly, my dad does not want me to actually USE any of the money I made from my previous job to buy college supplies.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Instead, he wants me to learn the horrors of minimum wage employment and induce me to to strive to succede in the college world.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>NEVERMIND the fact that my previous job gave me LESS money...I apparantly STILL need to understand that there is more to life than $5.50 an hour.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>GAH!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I KNEW that most jobs sucked unless you had a degree (and even then, most STILL sucked)!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Why bother to teach me THE SAME FREAKIN' LESSON AGAIN!?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Eh.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I didn't argue, mostly 'cause my dad IS paying for most of the college expenses...so I am grateful.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I just hate K-Mart.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So...today was my biggest shift ever, from 3 pm to 8 pm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It's the latest I've ever worked, too.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I know it's NOTHING compared to a full time job...but it's still enough to make me snap.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>FIRST OF ALL...well...there weren't a lot of customers during the first half of my shift.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Blessing, or horrible boredom?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In either case, I managed to obtain a Bag of Air from a purse someone bought, and (true to form) instead of discarding said air bag, I drew a face on it and decided that it was my pet, Bag.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Oh, me and Bag had great times.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I taught Bag how to return (I threw him at a fan and he blew into my face). I introduced Bag to a customer I knew (after they left and I was alone, even I knew that talking to a Bag is weird).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>*sigh*<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I hugged and squeezed Bag harder than I have ever squeezed a Moose, because I knew that Bag didn't have stuff like organs.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The worst that could have happened that he would have exploded in my face, blinding me forever.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ahhhhh...Bag.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then...*sniffle* tragedy struck.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I left my register to get something to restock the candy...and when I came back...Bag was missing!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Frantic, I looked around, and saw, before my very eyes, a fellow cashier puncture my precious Bag with a key!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They had thought that Bag was garbage!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I had customers and so I had to deal with them, with a false smile plastered painfully on my face, while all the while I was repeating over and over the horrible scene.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Once the customers left (after what seemed like an eternity) I rushed over to wear I had seen Bag.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>He wasn't there.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I looked in the garbage can...he wasn't there.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I looked in some nearby boxes...he wasn't there.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I couldn't ASK the other cashier what she had done with Bag...no one at K-Mart knows my true weird nature yet.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So...I regretfully had to forego giving Bag his needed funeral respects.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We had some good times together...and we had JUST started to bond when his life was ended.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I knew that it would happen, eventually.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Even if I had managed to bring him home, I would eventually have lost interest.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Bag was the perfect companion for my boring hour and a half.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But Bag was no more.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As the time dragged on, more and more customers came.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>During the last hour, the customers started to dwindle off (cool word, huh...dwindle...say it!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Dwiiiiiindle...)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was once again left bored.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I eventually grabbed a piece of cardboard (hmmmm...that came discarded from a bag I sold, too...coincidence?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think not!)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>and started to draw a cute little bunny and a tiger...(GAH!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think I left that at the register...I bet that EVIL other cashier is throwing it away, right NOW!).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was able to draw in peace for a while, with only the most minor of customer interruptions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then...the other Cashier went on her brake.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>We are allowed 15 minutes for our breaks.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>She went 17 minutes before I my shift was over.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Can you guess what happened?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>*sigh* I HAD been planning to close up shop at about 7:53 and clock out on TIME for once ( I usually close when I'm supposed to leave and end up clocking out 5 minutes after).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So...I am looking forward to doing a little shopping (for hand-held Nerf guns) before my parental unit came to pick me up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So, predict, if you will, what happend exactly 10 mintues before I was going to close.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>You can't?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Well...let me tell you:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THE STORE APPARANTLY DECIDED THAT IT WAS TIME FOR THEM TO LEAVE.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Not all at once, oh, no, they were more subtle than that.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>At first, all I felt was mild annoyance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I even thought, oh, I guess I won't finish my pic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then, ten more people were in the line.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I thought about asking the last person to prevent more people from entering, but I though, Hey, why bother?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It's not as if there can be many more people in the store, right?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Wrong.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>As I widdled (another cool word) my way through the customers, MORE KEPT COMING.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After barely having any ALL DAY, all of them swarmed like a hive of malevolent bees.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>GRRRRRR... This time I DID ask the last person to keep others out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Everyone seemed to be amused.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was the only cashier, where would other people go?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I explained that they could check out at the service deck, which was an exhausting 25 ft away (I was more polite though).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Finnally.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It was 8:05 and I was on my last customer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was irratated that I wouldn't have enough time to get the Nerf gun, but other than that I was just eager to get home.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ahhh...those last customers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think they were sent just to try my patience.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>First of all, they bought a few expensive items.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They gave me a gift card, and they still had $59 left to pay.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They tried to pay with credit, but it turned out they didn't have enough dough in their account to pay.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So, they wrote me a check for half the ammount, and then tried to pay the rest with credit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The credit machine froze.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After fiddling with it for a few minutes, I walked those hazardous 25ft to the service desk to ask for assistance.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I waited while the person delt with a customer.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I heard someone call my name.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>MY customers were frantically gestering to me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So I walked back.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It seems that they had overestimated their credit account.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>BUT, their boyfriends showed up and gave them 5 bucks, so they gave THAT to me and then paid the rest with credit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They left, I closed up.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I shut my register off at 8:20 pm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I glanced outside and saw my parental waiting on me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I angrily stalked all the way to the back, and clocked out.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then I stalked back and got in the car, at 8:30pm.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was furious.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I had suppressed ALL emotions while actually working, but as soon as I stepped away from that register my dam broke and I was awash in them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Gah!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Suppression of self (my technique for dealing with any situation involving strangers) just applified my anger by suppressing it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>By the time I got home, all I wanted to do was mutilate and slaughter helpless animals on my favorite video game (supposidly, the point of the game is to save the world, but I just like shooting the life like animals).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Of course, when I got to the PS2...the game was not there.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I had left it in my OLD PS2 that I had taken with me on my vacation.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The PS2 is in a box, right next to me at this very moment.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The game is inside it.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I COULD plug it in and obtain the game...but by now I have mostly excorized my emotions by reliving them by adding to this Longest Text Ever.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I KNOW it was a petty thing to get angry about...but I didn't want to job to begin with. (And poor, poor Bag...) I never WANTED a job where you might not get off on time...like my friends always complained about McDonalds.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Like them, if there are still customers...I can't leave! To make matters worse, it doesn't even feel as if I am working for money, since all I earn goes in a bank account for my future use.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I am present oriented!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I don't care about some hypothetical future!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It's as if I am working for the sole purpose of making my dad happy.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Eh...well...enough whining from me...<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Seeya.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hiya!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And I have a GREAT conspiracy/paranoid rant!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Don't you just feel all warm and gooey inside, like melted cheese?

How about pain medication?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Bannanas?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Milk?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ah!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>There we go.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Milk.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Just about EVERYONE has seen those GOT MILK? commercials.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Every school in my county has a cafeteria chock FULL of posters of celebraties with milk mustaches, with the logo:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>GOT MILK?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hmmmmm...sooooooooo...just WHAT do CHEESE and MILK have in common?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Let's see...BOTH are owned by the United Dairy Farmers of America.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hmmm...and it seems that OTHER countries have similar such organizations.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, there is even a CHICKEN Farmers organization (although apparantly it is not United).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But other food stuffs organizations just don't seem to be as active as these mysterious dairy farmers.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hmmmm...<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Why bother to advertise a product, without bothering to promote a single company or brand name?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Wouldn't you think that the companies could handle the advertising themselves?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I know Kraft does:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>*sing*K-R-A-F-T.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And lots of companies harp on the ammount of calcium in cheese.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Sooo..why do the FARMERS advertise milk and cheese?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Is it all a vast conspiracy?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>After all, this mysterious, spooky organization owns ALL THE CHEESE.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Shocking, isn't it?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So, this complete monopoly of the cheese world controls virtually all prices for all cheese/dairy items, including:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Cheese Pizza, Ice Cream, Milk, Cheese, CheeseBurgers, Tacos, Cheesy Bread, Cheese Doritos, Nacho Cheese, Butter, Etc.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>(Etc. is not actually a dairy product, consisitng mostly of an ecletic mix of random items, but I figured that it would work to show the continuing theme of dairy type items. )<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Why does the government allow such a monopoly to exist?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Are they FUNDED by the government? Let's see *does a google search*<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ooooo!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Pay Dirt!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I'm not the only one to see the evils of Got Milk!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;a href="http://www.cfif.org/htdocs/legislative_issues/federal_issues/hot_issues_in_congress/agriculture/fleecing_dairy_farmers.htm"&gt; THIS SITE&lt;/a&gt; has an arcticle about the anger of small dairy farmers for the monopoly of the "Got Milk?" people.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Jeff Manning, Executive Director of the California Milk Processor Board is apparantly in charge of this.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>What a strange title.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Hmmmm...*scans the article* Oooo!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>They notice the non-brand-specific advertising!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And it says how they are funded:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"So-called “generic” advertising programs such as “Got Milk?” and “Ahh, the power of cheese” are funded, in part, through the congressionally authorized dairy checkoff, which places a mandatory assessment of 15 cents per hundredweight (roughly two cents per gallon) on all milk domestically produced and marketed commercially.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Last year, the dairy checkoff raked in more than $250 million in hard-earned dairy producer money. "<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Soooo in essence, they ARE funded by the government (or at least in the sense that the government STEALS the small dairy farmer's money to pay for the ads).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And they were sued by a small farmer who said:<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>"We’re against having to fork over a huge portion of our bottom line for advertising that says all milk is equal."<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So they don't WANT to pay for the ads, but the government (and that California Dairy thingy) say they have to. Ha!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That's hilarious!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>These stupid Dairy Conglomorate people are actually PAYING a town to rename itself "Got Milk" with those small dairy farmer's money!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That's so pointless!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It's like they are having these HUGE brain-storming sessions to see how they can best squander those small dairy people's money!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Hmmmm...Bob, why don't we buy all those "Largest Block of Cheese" roadside attractions and make a monument with them, entitled 'Ahhh, the power of cheese!'?"<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Brilliant, Ted!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But, I'd like to go one step further!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Let's make an entire CITY out of cheese!"<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Bob, that's it!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Wait...wait!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I think I GOT IT!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Let's BUY a CITY the idiot yokels<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>to CHANGE THEIR NAME TO GOT MILK!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>That way, we can still have those cheese ideas to fall back on afterwards!"<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>*shakes head*<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It's so pathetic.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>*does happy dance* See, here I was ranting and raving about this, and it turns out that there already ARE people outraged!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It's like that rant about the smoke detectors, and later I saw a movie about spy cameras in them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Or that Grape Pie Rant that ended up with me doing a google search months later (When I was bored) and discovering a pic of it...mmmm....grape pie.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It's incredible how many strange things I can get outraged about, only to discover that they aren't strange at all!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Well...seeya! Wootage!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I'm back!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And I have a new rant about the evils of parental brain-washing during childhood.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Consider it a combo of the "Tag" rant and the "Mary Had a Little Lamb" rant.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>*shudders* How could I have missed such obvious implecations!?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Gah!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I shall focus!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Alright...the subject of today's whatchamacallit is:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Duck, Duck, Goose!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It is EVIL!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now, I KNOW that most of what small children learn is actually not-so-cleveraly disguised brain-washing attempts, but this is just plain wrong!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>For those of you not familiar with the game, let me summarize.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One child is "it" (JUST like in Tag).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This child, labels each of the children, usually as "duck".<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The other children are sitting in a circle, and the "it" child walks around tapping their heads, going:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>"Duck, Duck, Duck"...<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Simple enough, right?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ah, but THEN the "it" child picks somebody ELSE to be "it", and tap the unfortunate victim on the head, crying "Goose!".<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then the "goose" must pursue the "it" one and attempt to tag them.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If they do not tag the "it" child, the "goose" becomes "it".<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If they succede in tagging them, the "it" child goes in the "mush pot" and the "goose" becomes "it" anyway.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Alright.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Now you know what the game IS...let's move onto what it MEANS.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>First of all, the game is CLEARLY a mock witch hunt.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The children alienate and ostracize the one who is different, the one who is a "goose" when everyone else are "ducks".<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The "it" child is the current pariah, and obviously wants to exchange situations with a more fortunate child.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>So, the "it" child desperatly accuses another of being a "goose" (just as condemned witches accused others of witchcraft in order to alleviate their sentence).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The child, symbolically shocked and appaled by such wild accusations, denies it, and even goes so far as to pursue the accusing pariah.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>If the accusation is deemed false (i.e. the "goose" tags the "it") then the accusing "it" child is sent to exile (the mush pot).<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>HOWEVER, the taint of suspicion is already upon the former "goose" and despite protestations to the contrary, the child is the new "it" pariah.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>And the game continues. This game is DESIGNED to teach children how to shun those who are different, and to ostracize them from society if neccessary!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>How can this POSSIBLY be one of those little life's lessons that children must learn to become Responsible Adults?<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>*shakes head in disgust*<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Well, anyway, that's it for today!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Seeya!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I'm back!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>*giggles wildly* Woot! I have something EXTRA SPECIAL for you loyal readers *cricket chirps yet again...what is UP with that?*!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;a href="aboutmeg.html"&gt;"Meg"&lt;/a&gt;, the inspiration to that Pointless Signs of America Rant, has "agreed" to do a rant for us!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>It's GREAT! *giggles* Well, here it is:<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>&lt;i&gt;"Meg" here. Jenny has kindly asked aka threatened me to do a guest rant, and</p>
<p class="p1">I am only too happy to oblige. So here I am ready to inform you of silly</p>
<p class="p1">things! Let's start! Go! Go! It has come to my attention that Barbie has</p>
<p class="p1">finally found a new love. That's right. Bye-bye to boring Ken! Here comes</p>
<p class="p1">Australian surfer Blaine! At this point, a few of you will be screaming:</p>
<p class="p1">"No! Ken and Barbie forevaaaaa!" An insane percentage of you will be going:</p>
<p class="p1">"Oh, that is so cute, Barbie and Blaine! That's great cause, like, both of</p>
<p class="p1">their names start with B! Heehee!"<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But most of you will be wondering if</p>
<p class="p1">that leftover pizza a week ago that is still in the fridge is eatable. Trust</p>
<p class="p1">me on this, it's not. So why am I bringing this up? How many of you remember</p>
<p class="p1">playing with Barbies? (The guys reading this.pretend it's G.I. Joe and his</p>
<p class="p1">buddies.) Remember when you ripped off Barbie's head and it gave that</p>
<p class="p1">satisfying pop? And how there was always one Ken doll and a whole bunch of</p>
<p class="p1">Barbies? And Ken had to choose from his little harem which one he wanted? It</p>
<p class="p1">was actually training to make you used to Reality TV! The Bachelor is eerily</p>
<p class="p1">similar to the game you played as a child. Ken has to choose between Vet</p>
<p class="p1">Barbie, Cowgirl Barbie, Teacher Barbie, and Dolphin Trainer Barbie! There's</p>
<p class="p1">also a million dollars thrown into the mix! (Guys: G.I. Joe has to decide</p>
<p class="p1">which of his buddies to vote off the island or something.)<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Ken was always a</p>
<p class="p1">favored one! But now with him gone, (Barbie was quoted saying something</p>
<p class="p1">like, "So long, ya pansy!) how will young girls (and boys) tolerate Reality</p>
<p class="p1">TV when they are older? Mattel and TV producers are realizing their</p>
<p class="p1">mistakes, so they decided to hold a vote for the "new man" of Barbie. This</p>
<p class="p1">vote again was a little Reality TV thing in progress. The Bachelorette this</p>
<p class="p1">time. Who will Barbie choose? The trendy new guy she chose which, over 2</p>
<p class="p1">million people decided, was Blaine. Now, girls (and boys) will be racing to</p>
<p class="p1">get him and the many clothes and surfboard accessories he will undoubtedly</p>
<p class="p1">have.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Marketing goes up, and a new generation of potential Reality TV</p>
<p class="p1">watchers is created. The endless cycle continues. I hope you enjoyed my</p>
<p class="p1">rant! And remember!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>May Blaine always help the masses decide: American Idol</p>
<p class="p1">Barbie or Survivor Barbie.</p>
